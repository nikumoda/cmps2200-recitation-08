- **1b)**

Work: O((V+E) log V) since using Dijkstra's algorithm with a heap. Span: O(V log V) since each node is processed once and heap operations are log.

- **2b)**

Work: O(V+E) for BFS and path reconstruction. Span: O(V+E) for BFS, O(V) for path reconstruction (since path length less than or equal to V).
